      <h1>PRESENTING INFORMATION</h1>
      <h4>In English</h4>
     </div>

     <p>Estimated time: 5 - 20 minutes <i>(depending on level of skill and interest)</i>

      <hr/>

     <div class="content body">
      <h3>What do you have to do and why?</h3>
      <p>In this task you must present numeric and graphical information in English. Follow the steps below:</p>
      <ol>
       <li>Think of a good question to ask that can be answered with numbers or a graph like <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/pie-chart-movies.svg">this pie chart</a> or <a href="https://plot.ly/~PlotBot/40/sf-zoo-vs-la-zoo.png">this bar chart</a>. For example:
        <ul>
         <li>What is the most popular TV series or movie in your class?</li>
         <li>What careers or studies will your classmates persue after graduation?</li>
         <li>5 students have been to France; 1 to Germany; 2 to Malta; 4 to England; 1 to the U.S.; 1 to Australia; etc.</li>
        </ul>
	<p>For more ideas you may ask your classmates or your teacher (I can always think of something) or explore one of my favorite forums: <a href="https://reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful">/r/dataisbeautiful</a>
       </li>
       <li>Think about how you are going to ask this question and collect the information. Say you want to know <i>who</i> has been to <i>what</i> country. Everytime you hear a new country, write it down and mark it like this: Belgium I. As you go around maybe you learn that 2 more students have been to Belgium so you should now have written down: Belgium III</li>
       <li>Go ahead and begin your survey  by asking questions in the way you just planned. Use the Country example above to tally scores (Beglium has a tally of 3: Belgium III)</li>
       <li>The tricky part: enter this information into a spreadsheet. In one column should be one value (ie. Belgium), and in another column should be a numerical value (ie. III). This can be done in less than 2 minutes with Microsoft Excel. If you do not have Excel, you can use the <a href="https://office.live.com/start/Excel.aspx">free version online</a> or with a spreadsheet app on a mobile device, however these may not enable you to do the next task (making a graph). For that you may need the help of a friend, the school's computer, or by downloading an open source alternative such as <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>, which is free AND you have the option of challenging yourself even more if you decide to install it in English (reccomended for anyone in B2 or higher).</li>
       <li>The even trickier part: making a graph. If you already know how to do this then great news - you have an easy homework assignment. If not, this is a good listening or reading plus <i>thinking in English</i> exercise by following a tutorial (Google or YouTube). You'll have to turn that information on your spread sheet into something visible for everyone to see and understand in an instant. Like a pie chart or bar graph (as we saw before)</li>
       <li>You will have to present your graph in front of the class so once your satisfied with it, print it out and think about what you are going to say. A good idea is write a quick summary (just 1 to 4 sentences is enough) of your project. You may also send me your chart by submitting it on the <a href="https://dnbottesolutions.moodlecloud.com">moodle platform</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Go ahead and get started. If you think this activity is a dumb waste of time, see below:</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Why do this? Several reasons, really:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>It's an interactive activity that challenges you to think critically and in English.</li>
       <li>You will learn how to make presentations in English</li>
       <li>Many students need to know how to do this task if they are taking a higher level exam such TOEFL/TOEIC, CAE, CPE, the SAT, and, quite infamously, IELTS Writing Task 1.</li>
       <li>You'll probably have to use these skills if you study at a university. If you study in a country that speaks English, you MUST know how to do this, even if you are going to a highshool. (my elementary school had us learning them when we were 11 years old!)</li>
       <li>If you want to persue studies or a career in Business, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), and even various areas of law, you will need these skills.</li>
       <li>Most importantly: it is the year 2017: we are in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age">Information Age</a>. Everyone should know how to read data and interperate data on a basic level.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Still not convinced you should do this? Congratulations! I have a writing assignment for you as an alternative. Chances are you have an exam that may ask you to write a persuasive essay, or you'll need to write something convincing one day for work like a sales pitch or business proposal. Your assignment is to write a letter to your teacher explaining to him in about 80 to 100 words why you think this assignment is a waste of time. Good luck! (and don't forget to plan before and proof read at least twice)</p>
