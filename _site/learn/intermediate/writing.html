      <h4 style="text-align:center">General Advice for Intermediate Level Learners</h4>
      <hr/>
      <p>Writing is very useful. Many students think they only need writing for an exam. To understand why this wrong, think of how often you must write something.</p>
<p>Here is a <i>limited</i> list of situations where knwoing how to write well will come in handy:
<ul>
 <li>Job applications</li>
 <li>University applications</li>
 <li>Business proposals</li>
 <li>Advertisements to sell your product or service abroad</li>
 <li>Legal documents and memos</li>
 <li>Publications, especially research because in today almost all research is translated into English, if it is not already written in it initially</li>
 <li>Professional correspondence</li>
 <li>Requests for foreign aid or services</li>
 <li>Visa applications</li>
 <li>Medical reports</li>
 <li>Patents, copywrites, and intellectual property rights</li>
 <li>Websites</li>
</ul>ï»¿
<p>Which of these apply to you? If you plan on doing anything abroad or internationally, chances are you will need to write at least 2 or 3 of these examples.</p>
<p>Can you think of any other reasons?</p>
<p>Try and think of 3 or 4 more.</p>

<h4>General Writing Advice</h4>
<p>Writing is an easy skill to develop independently with practice. Writing well is not easy to master. Quite often students begin with the belief that listening and speaking are the most difficult skills to master only to realise that writing <i>well</i> can be much more challenging. Quite often it requires the assistance of a teacher and frequent evaluation by a native speaker.</p>
<p>Like most other skills, writing often is the key to improvement. When you improved in other forms of communication, did you do so overnight by forcing your way through hours of reading or listening? Or did you develope your skills gradually over time by practicing a little everyday?</p>
<p>There are a few steps you can take to improve the quality of your writing:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <h5>Planning</h5>
  <p>Most students overlook this critical phase in writing. Planning what you write is one of the smartest ways to write well. It saves you time and makes it easier to complete your task by organising the structure of your writing and the details you wish to include.</p>
  <p>The two most popular forms of planning are Word Webs and Outlines.</p>

  <h5>REVISE</h5>
  <p>While most students remember to revise, they do not exercise best revision practices and they only revise once - <strong>you should try to revise <i>at least</i> two times!</strong></p>
 <p>Why revise?</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Revisions are much more effective at detecting, identifying and correcting mistakes than doing so as you write. Mistakes are not just grammatical and spelling: sometimes writing is incoherent or a word is misused.</li>
   <li>
    <p>Revisions are an opportunity to adjust your writing by <i>saying more with less</i>, a very important practice.</p>
    <p>Saying more with less means you use fewer words to convey more information. This is important for two reasons:</p>
    <ol>
     <li>It improves the quality of your writing by increasing efficiency: your audience receives more information by reading less, just as you provide them with more by doing less.</li>
     <li>If you only have a limited amount of space to write, this allows you to consolidate more information into a smaller space. This is advantageous when your university application must be on one page, or PET exam has a 35-45 word limit, or maybe you steal the President's Twitter account.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
   <li>You have a second chance to make use of that vocabulary you've been working so hard by using more precise words. It's easier to sit back and think on a better way to say things when you're revising as opposed to when you're concentrating on completing a much larger task.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Why revise twice?</p>
  <p>Perhaps you may have missed a mistake the first time you read your writing, or you made another mistake while in your revision itself.</p>
  <p>Many ideas for change formulate between the first and second revision.</p>
  <p>A second reading is often easier to work with</p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <h5>PEER REVIEW</h5>
  <p>A second opinion never hurts. Peer reviewing is your chance to receive constructive criticism on how to improve what you have written and perhaps your writing in general. You should still revise your writing before submitting it to be reviewed.</p>
 </li>
</ul>

<p>Even if you are learning to write just for an exam, you should still consult the section of this page on<a href="#genW">General Writing Advice</a>. The best way to do well on your writing exam is to become better at writing in general.</p>
