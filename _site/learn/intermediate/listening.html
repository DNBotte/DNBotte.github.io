      <p>The second skill we will focus on is listening. Like reading, listening is a skill you can easily practice outside of class because it does not require an instructor or native speaker. There are a variety of ways to practice listening, many of which are free. Again, I would suggest you have fun exploring your options and try to find something enjoyable so you want to do it more often.</p>
      <p>Many students enjoy listening to music and studying lyrics. It is a fun way to train your ear to pick up on words in English, as well as an opportunity to learn many new words and expressions. Unfortunately this exercise is very limited at improving interpersonal communication. It is better to listen to actual dialogues, (conversations, people speaking, speeches, etc). Films and television in English with the subtitles in English are a better option if you can follow them. If they are too advanced, there are YouTube videos intended on helping you learn using the same method. Regular YouTube videos are good as well, however the subtitles are not always accurate.</p>
      <p>Podcasts are another option. They are probably one of the fastest ways to develop listening skills. A podcast is an audio file that can be downloaded and played on a smartphone, tablet, mp3 player, or computer. Think of it as a radio broadcast that you can play on your phone. All you have to do is install a podcast app on your phone, find something you're interested in (news, sports, politics, science, comedy, etc.) I listen to podcasts while I walk my dog and commute to work. I have listed below some suggestions of podcasts for learning English</p>
      <h2 id="skip">Here are some suggestions to help you:</h2>

	<li><h4>BBC's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/features/6-minute-english/ep-170112">6 Minute English</a></h4></li>
