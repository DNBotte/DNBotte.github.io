      <h4 style="text-align:center">Helping you understand your instructor</h4>
	<hr/>
      <p>Are you unable to understand spoken English?</p>
      <p>I have a solution for you! I call it: "the Slow English Method". It trains your ears to identify words and your mind to comprehend sentences.</p>
      <p>First, you will need an app to play podcasts, unless you would prefer to listen to this podcast <a href="http://slowenglish.info">directly from the website</a>.</p>
      <ul>
	<li><h4>iPhone users:</h4> search for the "podcast" app in the App Store</li>
	<li><h4>Android:</h4> search for any podcast app using the Google Play Store app.<p> I use an app called "Podcast Addict". I will post a guide on using it in the future.</p></li>
	<li>Rob McCormack, the publisher of Slow English, has also posted <a href="http://slowenglish.info/?page_id=2218">his own guide on downloading and playing the podcast</a>.  
	<li>In your podcast app, search for a podcast titled "Slow English" or "Slow English Rob McCormack"</li>
	<li>You may need to click "Download" or "Subscribe".</li>
      </ul>
	<hr/>
      <p>After you have downloaded and listened to an episode, take the relevant quiz on <a href="http://slowenglish.info">slowenglish.info</a>. Most smarthphone browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) support this, so you probably will not need a computer.</p>
      <p>When you have completed the quiz, record your score somewhere you won't lose it. In the future you will discover why this is a good idea.</p>
      <p>Now listen again, but this time read the transcript at the same time. Follow the words Rob says on your screen. When you are done, repeat the quiz and record your new score.</p>
      <p>Did your quiz results improve? Was Rob easier to understand the second time? Did reading help?</p>
      <p>If you answered no to the first two questions, don't worry. This requires dedication. As we say in English "practice makes perfect". This is why you should never lose your quiz results. Many students begin with only 2/10 or 4/10 correct, and still less than 7/10 on their second attempt. This is not unusual. In fact, many of the best students began this way, but became very motivated when one month later they compared their recent scores to their first ones. Many stop needing the transcript and only have to listen once to score higher than 8/10! Keep track of your performance and don't give up!</p>
      <p>There are a few more things you can do with this exercise. You should check the vocabulary Rob posts below each transcript. You could learn a lot of useful words and understand the podcast better. If you are taking conversation lessons, you should write a summary of the podcast. This means describe the episode in 5 - 10 sentences. This helps your instructor evaluate your reading and it helps you with speaking. You could also do more research on the topic. For example, Rob published an episode on Australian inventions. You could write about inventions from your country, or from other English-speaking countries (there are lots from the UK and US), or your personal favorite inventions or ones that you believe are important. This gives you more to talk about in class. You should also think of some questions to ask your instructor.</p>
      <p>I have been using what I call "the Slow English Method" for years - since I first began teaching my wife and our friends and family. All of my best beginner and intermediate students tell me it is one of the best exercises they have ever done. That's why it has its own activity page on my website.</p>
      <p>Good luck!</p>
