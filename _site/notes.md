original file: indexOriginal.html

This is the default Jekyll blog template that comes standard. Keep it as an example of how everything was original integrated just to get an idea of how this is supposed to work. Perhaps change the name to jekyll.html
If one day a blog is to be created, maybe use it. Rename it as the blog is supposed to be.
