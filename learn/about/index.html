      <h4 style="text-align:center">with David Botte</h4>
	<hr/>
      <h3>Why</h3>
      <p>Learning English with David is where I store all of the resources I've used while teaching in Italy. Although I no longer teach full time, many of my students and fellow teachers continue to ask me for some of the materials they've used in the classroom as well as things used in other classes. I also add new stuff periodically and update anything obsolete.</p>
      <h3>When</h3>
      <p>The need for a website began after acquiring too many students of too many sorts. In less than a year I was already dishing out assignments to over 400 learners, ranging all the way from absolute beginner to near masters. This made lesson planning tiring and time consuming. There had to be an easier way to centralize flexible resources for all students which could be accessed any time of day. Another factor weighing in on this was the reluctancy of schools to make photocopies of my assignments.</p>
      <h3>How</h3>
      <p>Originally everything was available on a virtual learning environmnet using the <a href="https://dnbottesolutions.moodlecloud.com">Moodle Cloud</a> LMS. I wanted to make everything accesible to all on my website <a href="http://davidnbotte.space">www.davidnbotte.space</a> but I didn't want to spend money hosting my website. Github offered free hosting for static sites, but copying and pasting became tedious compared to a scaleable CMS. Eventually I tried using a Jekyll server again. I threw out the template it came with and made my own layouts and includes using elements that frequently appeared in my pages.</p>
