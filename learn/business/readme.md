# Business English

This is where all of the business English stuff should go

Once testing works out, rename as /businessenglish/ (optional) and change url in the following includes:
* learnNav
* learnLeft
and check other pages (eg. resources by type)

This should be divided into the following sections:

* BE homepage
* resources for BE
* BE exams
* blog
* news articles

Might need a seperate page or section for professional English
