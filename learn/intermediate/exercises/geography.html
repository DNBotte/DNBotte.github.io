      <h4>An Interactive Project</h4>

      <h3>UPDATE 2017/05/10:</h3>
      <h4>This page is being redisgned due to confusion with past courses. If you are from Cambridge Academy, HiOffer, iTalki, or Righi, read what is here for now just to get an idea of what to do.</h4>
      <p>In this project you will give a presentation on a place where English is spoken as first language. It may be a country, such as Canada, or a state, such as California, or an city, like London, or an island, such as Jamaica, or an entire continent, but that would be limited to either North America or Australasia. I suggest you choose a place that you've always wanted to explore or learn more about. You will have to do research on it and give a powerpoint presentation to the entire class.</p>
      <p>Follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
       <li>Think of what you'd like to report on and who you'd like to work with. You may work with one or two other students. Think carefully of both: as mentioned earlier, choose a place that you actually <i>want</i> to research. I've had the laziest, least motivated, and unengaged students do a terrific job because they've always wanted to know more about Las Vegas (yes, they all choose Las Vegas). Be careful about who you do this project with - make sure it is someone who you can work hard with and not waste time social networking.</li>
       <li>Start exploring that place online. Look up what interesting things there are to see or do there (ie. Washington D.C. - the National Air and Space Museum, the White House, the Japanese Cherry Blossoms, etc.), what is it famous for (Australia - Funny accents, Kangaroos, Crocodile Dundee, the Crocodile Hunter, Crocodiles and other dangerous animals), interesting facts about the place (USA - population: 313 million, [in]famous president(s), it's really big and everything there supposedly is really big), find some nice pictures, walk around on Google Earth, etc. If that place doesn't motivate you then find another.</li>
       <li>Come to class with a list of places you'd like to report on and we'll decide what to do next.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>As always: why are you doing this?</h3>
      <ul>
       <li>If you haven't guessed it already, I believe and continue to prove that interactive activities are the best way to learn</li>
       <li>You'll get plenty of practice reading things that are much more interesting the Cambridge exams</li>
       <li>You'll get practice speaking</li>
       <li>It's a great teamwork activity, and teamwork is an important skill that sadly isn't emphasized in many schools.</li>
       <li>You will develop some valuable research and reporting skills like Googling, Powerpoint, public speaking etc.</li>
       <li>It should be a fun and interesting activity. Think it's boring? Think about all those atrocious literature books your teachers make you memorize.</li>
