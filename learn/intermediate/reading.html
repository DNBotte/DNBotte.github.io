      <h1 style="text-align:center">Reading</h1>
      <h6 style="text-align:center">(Click <a href="#skip">here</a> to skip to the reading list)</h6>
      <p>This page lists various resources for reading. It will continue to grow into the future, and exercises will be added to it. If you are taking a course with me, <a href="#skip">skip</a> to the reading list and find something you'd enjoy.</p>
      <p>It's a good idea to practice reading on a daily basis, even if only for 5 minutes. Too many days without reading in another language makes things difficult to understand and often causes students to stop reading for many more days or simply quit. Reading in English improves listening, which can improve speaking in conversations. It also improves writing, one of the most difficult areas for students. Finally,there is no better way to expand your vocabulary than seeing new words.</p> 
      <p>Fortunately reading is free! You don't need an instructor, you can read whenever you want, and read whatever you want.</p>  
      <p>The best way to find yourself reading often is to look for things you would enjoy. I have listed some intermediate leveled resources below. Take a look at whichever options seem most interesting to you</p>

      <h3 id="skip" style="text-align:center">Reading List</h3>
      <ul>
       <li>Many students like blogs. You can find one on any of your interests simply by Googling them with the word "blog".
       </li>
       <li>Teachers and exam guides often reccomend newspapers. While I do agree that they provide the best sources to improve your reading, you do not have to limit your reading to them. Here are some examples:
       <ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/international">The Guardian</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/">The Washington Post</a></li>
       </ul>
       </li>
       <li>If you are taking a Business English exam, is it absoultely essential that you read the news. I would suggest trying to read these when you are ready:
       <ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ft.com/">The Financial Times</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.wsj.com/europe">The Wall Street Journal</a></li>
       </ul>
       </li>
       <li>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/">BBC's Learning English site</a> has a lot of materials. If you are taking a Cambridge exam, you might want to visit <a href="http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/">their website</a>. The  <a href="http://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/en/">British Council</a> also has a good site. They are the co-creators of <a href="https://www.ielts.org/">IELTS</a>. You can find simulated exam exercises on <a href="">ExamEnglish.com</a>.
       </li>
       <li><a href="https://reddit.com"><h4>Reddit.com</h4></a>
	<p>Reddit is probably the best place to begin. It is a combination of forums on almost every topic imaginable. It is the most popular forum on the internet.</p>
	<p>Here you can find articles, stories, images, videos, and websites on whatever you'd like. Some people enjoy entertainment like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies">/r/movies</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming">/r/gaming</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/music">/r/music</a>. I enjoy catching up on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> and staying ahead with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/futurology">/r/futurology</a>, or in the past on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/history">/r/history</a>. Many students find interesting articles and news on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science">/r/science</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology">/r/technology</a>. I learned how to build this website on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming">/r/learnprogramming</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/freecodecamp">/r/freecodecamp</a>, and I hope my students would finds things to bake for me on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/">/r/baking</a>. There is even an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/englishlearning">/r/EnglishLearning</a> to help you learn this language! Go ahead and search whatever your interests are, and don't forget to explore <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/5om5zn/nasa_to_explore_asteroid_made_of_10000/">the comments section</a> of the articles posted for a discussion.</p>
