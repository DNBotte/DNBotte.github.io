___
This repo contains all the code for my personal website, [www.davidnbotte.space](https://davidnbotte.space), which is hosted on GitHub.

This site is my first, and it was launched in the summer of 2016 as my first. A previous version of it was delpoyed using the [Jekyll static site generator](http://jekyllrb.com/). The content of that site is now stored in [another repo](https://github.com/DNBotte/DNBotte.github.ioJekylRubyServer). 

I plan to restore some of the Jekyll content in the near future after I am done testing a few themes that I like. I also intend on improving the layout of [English with DavidNBotte](https://davidnbotte.space/learn) so that the ESL students I used to teach can always access the material I've shared with them and continue to expand upon.
